How to run our program (program.py or program.ipynb): 
1. Install all the necessary Python packages that are mentioned in our program.
2. Update the relative input file path for three folders of test cases: easy, moderate and difficult. 
3. Run the main function and you will get the results (more in our writeup). 
4. You can change the h_flag (0,1,2) for different heuristic functions.
